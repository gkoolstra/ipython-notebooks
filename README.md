# Notebook repository

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for analysis of experimental data, running and analyzing simulations etc. There's a heavy dependence on my other repositories, especially [Trap-Analysis](https://github.com/gkoolstra/Trap-Analysis) and [Common](https://github.com/gkoolstra/Common).  

The folder `scripts` contains Python files related to simulations. They rely on data that are not publicly available. They also have dependencies on the two modules above. Everything is written in Python 3. 

All work here is not allowed to be copied or used in any context without explicit permission of the [author](https://github.com/gkoolstra).
